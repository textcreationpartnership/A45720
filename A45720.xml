            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Who ſeeing him reſolute ſo to doe, at length opened the doore and let them in; her Husband then getting betwixt her and the door, they both kneeled, and Mr <hi>Dod</hi> (as his cuſtome in great matters was) kneeled and went to prayer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpeaking of one word unto her: at which time ſhee ſtood and would not kneele, untill the latter end of the ſame, when ſhee alſo conformed her ſelfe, and kneeled with them. Prayer being done, Mr <hi>Dod</hi> ſaid nothing unto her, but in her hearing uttered ſome ſpeeches concerning her Caſe,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:55234:15"/>unto her Husband, tending unto her comfort and encouragement for her to make uſe off: and ſo did both before and at dinner, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting from her ſome ſpeeches to have given ſome pertinent occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for further diſcourſe with her, which ſhee at that time omitting, he ſupplied with other ſeaſonable diſcourſes for her good, touching his experiences in the like kinde, of the Devils ſuttleties and the danger of keeping his councell, with the advantages accrewing unto him thereby; whereunto ſhee partiently attended. Dinner being done, he being asked in his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber at her houſe (where hee now was perſwaded to lodge) what he thought of the buſineſſe? made this gratious hopefull Reply; <hi>very well, becauſe the Devill was afraid, run away, and durſt not ſtand to it.</hi>

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:55234:60"/>irreconciliable enmity betwixt thee and the bleſſed ſeed, I account her happy in that thou art her enemy, and that ſtrength is given her to fight againſt thee, for hereby I perceive that ſhee is none of thine, but ſtands on that ſide whereof Chriſt is the Captaine, and all the Saints are Souldiers; where the victory undoubtedly muſt bee both ſure and certaine on her ſide. O deceitfull Serpent! If we finde ſuch terrors and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes of thy fury for theſe ſmaller ſinners of frailty which we fooliſhly by thy enticement com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit; what ſhould we have found if wee had followed thee, in the reſt of thy deadly aſſiduall and unmeaſurable fiery injected temptations? from the which the Lords preventing and reſtraining

Why therefore ſhould we enter in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting with thee? for, her ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion conſiſts not either in thy queſtioning, or in her diſputing againſt it; but upon the Lords unchangeable Decree of Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. If thou ſhouldeſt ſpeak for her, and plead her cauſe, ſhe were ſo much the worſe, and nothing the better; and now that thou pleadſt againſt her, ſhe is nothing the worſe.

               <hi>Eſher</hi> Mr <hi>Drakes</hi> houſe; end ſo by this meanes, as to free Mr Dod from his toile and trouble, ſo to be at all aſſayes ready to mannage and work her ſpirit, encounter all her objections, eſpie all Satans windings and turnings, and catch her at all non-plus advantages, being acute, quick, nimble-witted, well skild in knowing and opening of the Scriptures; withall a good Logitian, a ſtrong Diſputant, as he could well doe. And ſo the good old man as occaſion ſerved, ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and writing unto her, after divers ſad and ſerious diſcourſes with her, wherein ſhee covenanted to obſerve all promiſes paſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining her former reſolutions in thoſe things wherin in judgement ſhe was convinced, he was for that time lovingly diſmiſſed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded largely by her Parents.</p>
            <pb n="119" facs="tcp:55234:64"/>
            <p>This man Mr <hi>Hooker</hi> being a good acute, ſmart Preacher when he liſted, beſides that information Mr <hi>Dod</hi> had given him, was ſo wife, firſt to trie her ſpirit, to finde her diſpoſition, uſing her with much mildneſſe &amp; love, ere he would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture to meddle with her ſpirit, chuſing rather that way made from her might uſher the way unto his diſcourſe, then that at firſt hee ſhould enforce any thing upon her: Which was not long in ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpence; for now having a fit perſon to rough hew her (as it were) whom ſhee could neither weary out nor over-come in Argument, but was able to diſcerne and catch Satan in all his Sophiſmes, there every way fell out ſtrong diſputes betwixt them: But all within the compaſſe of thoſe former things wherein Mr <hi>Dod</hi> before had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:55234:65"/>her: Satan delighting ſtill to raſe new uprores in her, and (as his cuſtome is) <hi>not to ſuffer us to be at peace though we be out of danger:</hi> Such now were his pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes anew, to winde up his old bottomes, and to renew diſputes, even in thoſe things ſhe was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of. For Mr <hi>Hooker</hi> being newly come from the Univerſity had a new anſwering methode (though the ſame things) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſhee was mervellouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted, and being very convetous of knowledge, was pleaſed with new diſputes and objections to faſten further upon her ſelfe thoſe forementioned things; ſtill fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and further ſifting into the ſame old Truths whereof ſhee was well perſwaded (and as is ſaid) convinced.</p>
            <p>Yet could not he ſo evenly hold
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:55234:65"/>the ballance in mannaging of her ſpirit, but that now and then ſhee would flie out,<note place="margin">By de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees ſhe is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times off hooks ſtill.</note> in many diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, <hi>wiſhing to leave off all, for ſhee now ſaw that there was no remedy, the meanes did not work nor prove effectuall unto her: To what purpoſe ſhould ſhee any more labour in vaine?</hi> But eſpecially towards the Sacrament, then uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſhee would be off hooks, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not comming, or unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if ſhee did: Upon whom this place for her waiting and depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon God was ſtrongly urged, <hi>Had.</hi> 3. <hi>ult.</hi> That the viſion of Gods deliverances, was for an appointed time, therefore to wait; for though it tarried, yet it ſhould come and not tarry; and that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of <hi>Iſai.</hi> 8. <hi>I will wait upon the Lord, who hath hid his face from the houſe of</hi> Jacob; <hi>and I will look for
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:55234:66"/>him:</hi> affirming unto her that theſe and the like hard travels, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident unto Gods beſt beloved people, to have many, hard and long trialls, and yet at length glorious deliverances, as was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged from that place, <hi>Amos</hi> 3.2. <hi>You only have I known of all the Nations of the earth; therefore I will puniſh you for your iniquities:</hi> (which God may doe forgiving the ſinne, <hi>though hee take ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of their inventions:)</hi> And that <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. what ſonne is there whom the Father chaſteneth not? If therefore yee bee without cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection (whereof all are partakers) then are yee baſtards and not ſonnes. Which with the like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuations from the word cloſely urged, brought down her ſpirit to mildneſſe and meekneſſe: For though her indiſpoſition and
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:55234:66"/>temptations, made her many times contrary unto her naturall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition harſh and untoward, with the habite ſhee had accrewed in time to be croſſe, and try thoſe ſoundly ſhee converſed with; <hi>yet this happy endowment ſhee had, to be very rationall according unto her conception, and would be ſet down and ſatisfied with pregnant places of Scripture being ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly preſſ'd and lovingly opened un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the matter of repentance much troubled her,<note place="margin">Queſt. of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed.</note> that ſhe could not repent; demanding, <hi>Whether it were poſsible for her to goe to Heaven without Repentance?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hereunto was anſwered: Firſt,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> 1.</note> That God did not tie ſalvation unto any meaſure of repentance; but might at his pleaſure ſave, eſpecially where there were no
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:55234:67"/>groſſe ſinnes to dam up mercies gates; whereof praiſed bee God ſhee was free.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That God exacted no more of his creatures then he gave unto them: as the Apoſtle to the the <hi>Corinths</hi> writes, <hi>If there be firſt a willing minde, accepting of us, not according unto thoſe things we have not, but according unto thoſe things we have:</hi> And therefore, that her weak deſires and meaſure whatſoever given, might be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of God. For, ſhee could not deny, but her wiſhes were that ſhe might repent, and ſhe was in ſome ſort ſorry for her indiſpoſition and hardneſſe of heart, which being a burthen and a kinde of griefe unto her, was ſo a kinde and ſort of repentance: Therefore was ſhee exhorted to be patient, and not to limite the Holy One of
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:55234:67"/>
               <hi>Iſrael</hi> nor preſcribe the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and depth of all wiſedome which were the beſt way to bring her unto Heaven; but to ſubmit her ſelfe unto the good pleaſure of God; truſt, hope with the beſt, and uſe the meanes.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Further alleadging un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her, That it was not the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, number or continuance of our ſinnes that could ſtop mercy from us; but finall impenitency and obduration.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Repentance being the gift of God, which hee might at his pleaſure give and accept in good part whatſoever meaſure thereof he were pleaſed: It was not to be doubted of, but that ſhe might in time attaine unto ſo much thereof in the uſe of meanes, as hee would accept of, and as might bring her unto heaven. For
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:55234:68"/>God of all his Attributes is ſaid only to delight in mercy, <hi>Micah</hi> 7. his nature being to forgive and forget iniquity, tranſgreſſion, fin and ſinnes of cuſtome.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, That as ſinne was a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall act in us, ſo in God there was a perpetuall act in pardoning of ſinne, not tranſient, but in a perpetuall conſtant currant; as <hi>Zach.</hi> 13.1. <hi>a fountaine opened, ever running, to waſh away act ſinne and uncleanneſſes;</hi> with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the like things, which now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine wonne her ſpirit to reſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God; though now and then upon divers occaſions ſhe uſed to fly out a little: Yet being continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally hammered and hewen with the tough acute diſputations of this good man, Mr <hi>Hooker,</hi> who was very aſſiduouſly induſtrious in watching her diſpoſition, and
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:55234:68"/>various inclinations of her changes and tentations; by Gods mercy ſhee grew ſtill better, uſing to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent her ſelfe conſtantly to the uſe of meanes: having prayer, cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizing, expounding and reading of the word, and ſinging of Pſalms conſtantly in the family, now with delight and willingneſſe acted: being never weary to have the word expounded; yea, and in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ſpending ſome time by her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe alone daily; as the indiſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her diſtempered body, heart-burning and in a manner perpetuall head-ach, would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit her; but yet would not bee known not confeſſe unto any alone.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The good ſoule is yet toſſed up and down.</note> Now have wee her in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe <hi>toſſed up and downe, like the Church in their march unto Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:55234:69"/>fraught with divers ſtormes, now backwards, now forwards, with many turning and winding temptations, reſtleſſe in her thoughts, becauſe (deſire hath no reſt) having ſome glimmering glimpſe of hope, but (as ſhe ſaid) had no grounds for the ſame, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting when the Lord would bee pleaſed to work in her ſome great work for enabling. In which Caſe, now up, now down, <hi>the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhee grew in her minde, having ſtill therewithall the greater weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and indiſpoſition of body,</hi> ſhe continued a long time, her old friend Mr <hi>Dod</hi> now and then once in a quarter of a year comming to viſite her, whom ſhe much rejoyced to ſee, praying not any more to ſtay ſo long away; for now ſhee reſted aſſured her time on earth was but of ſmall continuance.
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:55234:69"/>About which time, it fell out, that Mr <hi>Hooker</hi> alſo having acted his part with her, and done his beſt, to comfort, uphold and rectifie her ſpirit, ſo fitting her for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, as nothing remained to bee done but a full gaile of ſpirituall winde to blow upon her, to bring ſorth her fruit, that be Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence he was married unto her waiting-woman: After which both of them having lived ſome time after with her, and he cal'd to bee Lecturer at <hi>Chemsford</hi> in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> they both left her,<note place="margin">Maſter Hooker leaves her.</note> her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band having provided another for the Cure, but not like unto the other; who alſo came often to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite her, being much there. And there lived alſo two miles from thence, a worthy good Miniſter, one Mr <hi>Witherell</hi> of <hi>Waltham</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Thames,</hi> whom ſhee went con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:55234:70"/>to heare, and was alwayes very helpfull unto her (but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when Mr <hi>Hooker</hi> had thus left her) whom every Thurſday ſhee heard, hee being a painfull, able, good mercifull man, did then much help her, both in publike, and alſo in private helps of conference and expounding of the Word, which now ſhee much delighted in at all occaſion; eſpecially ſhee found a little comfort in opening of that chapter <hi>Micah</hi> 7. one time when Mr <hi>Dod</hi> was with her three Moneths before her death, though (as ſhee ſaid) ſhe durſt not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge nor confeſſe the ſame for feare it had not been ſo.</p>
            <p>But ah, ſhould I now lance forth into the diſcourſe of the loſſe of ſo good a friend?<note place="margin">The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration unto her death.</note> but what ſay I of loſſe? <hi>No, ſhe was not loſt, ſhee was now found with
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:55234:70"/>her face ſtrongly bent home Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards:</hi> Having therefore thus far proceeded in this ſaid <hi>Trage-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micall</hi> diſcourſe, I muſt now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the <hi>Cataſtrophe</hi> thereof: If therefore good Reader, thou wilt have a little more patience to heare the reſt, thou ſhalt quickly ſee the <hi>Scene change</hi> with a joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>Comicall</hi> concluſion: For though all this while ſhee hath gone forth weeping carrying pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſeed, <hi>now thou ſhalt ſee her returne with ſheaves of everlaſting joy;</hi> though weeping hath beene many an evening, <hi>yet now thou ſhalt ſee Joy come in an everlaſting morning.</hi> Though Satan hath much toyled, wearied out and vexed her ſpirit, <hi>yet thou ſhalt ſee how the God of peace ſhall ſhortly tread downe Satan under her feet:</hi> her reward infinitely ſurpaſſing all her
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:55234:71"/>momentany ſufferings; which now comes to hee the fourth and laſt thing propounded, <hi>Her death, and the preparation unto it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Divers years ſince Mr <hi>Dod</hi> left her, and ſome large time alſo after that Mr <hi>Hooker</hi> was removed unto <hi>Chemſford,</hi> ſhee remained more chearfull in minde, though tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with her heart-burning and in manner perpetuall <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grum,</hi> which made her to lie much of the day upon her bed, unfit for any other actions of endeavor in the uſe of meanes ſhe would or ſhould otherwiſe be employed in. About this time a ſtrong diſtaſte was given her from a neare friend,<note place="margin">A new griefe is added to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</note> (not neceſſary here to relate, nor to our purpoſe:) Which yet faſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſo upon her, that it grew more and more, and brought her into a poſture of great diſcontent, ſo as
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:55234:71"/>ſhee became in her thoughts a woman in ſome ſort of another world; who being reſolute in her way, unremoveable, having reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and alwayes purpoſing, when ſhee found her ſelfe neare unto her laſt, to die at her Fathers Houſe, and lie with her kindred and friends at <hi>Ammerſum, Shee ſuddenly told her Husband, that ſhee found her ſelfe very ill, and therefore that ſhee was purpoſed to goe ſuddenly unto her Fathers Houſe:</hi> Hee much wondering at the ſuddenneſſe of her reſolution, told her, If her reſolution were ſuch, to goe ſo quickly, his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe was ſuch as hee could not yet goe with her, unleſſe ſhe would ſtay until his buſineſſe was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatcht; but if ſhe were reſolute to goe, that hee would not ſtay her, ſhe might when ſhe would.
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:55234:72"/>So ſhee being reſolute, the next day with two of her men ſhee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted for her Fathers Houſe, where being arrived, they wonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that ſhee came ſo without her Husband, ſhee in plaine termes told them, <hi>That ſhee alwayes had reſolved to die at</hi> Sharolois, <hi>and therefore ſhee not knowing how long her time ſhould be, finding her weakneſſe great, had now come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out her husband to die there,</hi> ſaying, <hi>that her husband would ſhortly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They much wondering at this ſudden newes from her, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected ſtrange ſpeeches; yet at her comming ſmoothed her over, telling her that this was but ſome unwarranted feare had ſurprized her, and that ſhe would finde her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe herein as in many other ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed things deceived. But ſhee
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:55234:72"/>ſtill maintained the maine, that her time was at hand, and ſhe very weak, though ſhee carryed it faire; after which her Husband in a week or ten dayes arrived: But the poſture of her carriage for all this was the ſame, <hi>She being in a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſsing extraordinary ſtrange hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of talking of the beſt things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually night and day without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſsion, not having any jot of ſleep almoſt night or day;</hi> whereby her ſpirits were both much ſpent and tyred out.</p>
            <p>The Relator who ſtill had a watchfull eye upon all the paſſages of her occurrences,<note place="margin">Mr Dod is gone for to come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her once more</note> knowing of her late diſcontent and cauſe thereof, and hearing that ſhe was removed to <hi>Sharolois,</hi> made no more adoe, but with all haſte went and brought Mr <hi>Dod</hi> thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, fearing that this might
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:55234:73"/>prove his laſt journey unto her (as indeed it proved,) when he came unto her two Sundayes before her death, he by that time found her <hi>much weakned in body, keeping her bed; but with ſuch vehement deſires to diſcourſe of, and heare of the beſt things, reading, expounding and ſinging of Pſalmes, that all were ſtruck with admiration:</hi> and would not ſtay with her ſo long, as ſhee would have had us; nor read unto her, becauſe we would gladly have had her to reſt, which could not be done; for <hi>ſhee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſtill ſpeaking both night and day to ſome one or other who watched with her, yet all of the beſt things;</hi> for her time being ſhort, ſhe imagined (as ſhee ſaid) <hi>ſhee could not too advantagiouſly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the ſame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt of the two Sundayes

            <p>Now the Munday after this, was all ſpent in continuall confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence with Mr <hi>Dod,</hi> ſo much as he would conferre with her, for
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:55234:74"/>feare of over-toyling her ſpirits, ſhee being in the other extremity more forward to entertaine and ſpeak of the beſt things,<note place="margin">A ſtrange change.</note> then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſhee had beene backwards; which ſhewed ſome ſtrange change at hand: yet all this while could ſhee, or would ſhee never ſleep, night or day, but in a perpetuall motion of ſpeaking of variety of all ſorts of things; but by her good-will, ſtill of Divinity, and of the life to come, undervaluing all this world, and eating ſparingly.</p>
            <p>On the Tueſday next in the morning ſhee ſent for Mr <hi>Dod,</hi> who prayed and talkt a while with her, with variety of excellent diſcourſe of death, heaven and eternall glory; when ſuddenly as prayer was done, about eight of the clock in the morning we were ſtrangely enterrupted by a ſtrange

So (ſaid ſhe) <hi>ſurely it was, it was very ſtrange, But will you know how it ſurprized mee? As this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ere you came to prayer, I being alone prayed to God that hee would not abſent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe for ever: but that once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my death, hee would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veale Chriſt unto mee, give mee

I was like a piece of knotty timber, who have endured ſo many the more knocks with ſtrong wedges, ſo much adoe there was to work me; but now I thank God, who hath heard my prayer and revealed Chriſt unto me, and now
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:55234:78"/>I care not for all this world: The fountaine of all my miſery hath been, that I ſought for that in the Law which I ſhould have found in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and for that in my ſelfe which was only to be found in Chriſt. A wrong way I confeſſe, which hath occaſioned unto me ſo much ſorrow; but now all is well; O pray, pray, pray, O give thanks; for, now you have it, you have it, you have it.</p>

            <p>This ſo ſolid ſtrange ſpeech, ſo heavenly, rationall, gave a great deale of contentment unto all preſent; Mr <hi>Dod</hi> according unto her deſire, framing himſelf unto a prayer altogether of thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, admiring Gods infinite work in her, and for her, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching a happy cloſe of this great work begun: For matter of petition now ſhee cared not for, lying like a Conqueror, with an extraordinary cheerefull aſpect, full of rapt joy, as now ſhee had been poſſeſſor of all things, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no need of any thing; now that Chriſt was hers, all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hers alſo; the remainder of the day being ſpent in over-joyed ſpeeches, with exhortations to Thankſgiving; ſtill telling us, <hi>Now you have it, yee have it, you have it:</hi> and taking our hands

            <p>All the time ſhee had been ill, ſhee could not of all the Pſalmes endure to joyn in ſinging of the thirty Pſalme, but that night of her ſelfe ſhe cal'd for it, with this expreſſion, <hi>Couſin now turn to the thirty Pſalme</hi> (by the Relator al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes urged upon her to belong unto her) but I durſt never appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate or apply the ſame unto my ſelfe, until now, and ſo that Tueſday night ſung the ſame every cheerefully, as was ſaid, ſhe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing this night over alſo without any inclination to reſt or ſleep.</p>

            <p>Soone after this came Mr <hi>Dod</hi> and Dr <hi>Preſton</hi> to her, unto whom ſhe with a great deale of joy told the ſame diſcourſe as formerly ſhe had done unto her Mother, <hi>That thus as ſhee was then dreſt, ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to be laid in the grave:</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their departure having prayed with her and given thanks (for no

            <p>Being now very much ſpent, this Wedneſday after dinner, ſhee cauſed to voide her Chamber of every body, and ſent for her

            <p>Preſently after this ſhee called to ſpeak with the Relator,<note place="margin">Her farewell ſpeech to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator.</note> whom having made to ſit down by her,

               <hi>O no, ſaid ſhee, you muſt forgive me that you for ſo many yeares together having ſhewed mee ſo much love, and beene a meanes of my everlaſting comfort and happineſſe, that yet I have been ſo unkind unto you, for
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:55234:83"/>I have not loved you by the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred part, in that meaſure I ought to have done, according to that love you have ſhewed mee: But will you know the cauſe? I could love no body as I ſhould ſo long as I was not aſſured of Gods love to me (for that onely ſets our love a fire to runne ſtrongly the right way) I could untill then neither love you nor any body elſe, during ſo much diſtraction and diverſion as I ſhould have done: And now that my love is thus kindled, this is my ſorrow (my time being ſhort) that now I can no otherwiſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe my ſelfe then by this poore acknowledgement, in a time I am ſo unfit and diſabled to performe my deſires: But I well hope, that what I cannot doe, that God who ſet you a work you my good, and my other friends will performe, when I
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:55234:84"/>am gone:</hi> And ſo for that time with abundance of love and thanks diſmiſſed the Relator.</p>
            <p>Thus having in ſome ample manner diſpoſed of all the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſhee ſeemed to have in this world: The remainder of this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoone ſhee lay in her former joyfull poſture, rejoycing to ſpeak of the beſt things unto every one neare unto her; yet without any reſt or ſleep, or inclination that way. When Mr <hi>Dod</hi> and Dr <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton</hi> came to viſite her, ſhee ſtill entreating to give thanks, no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſcourſe ſhee had, as want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing: So continuing all this day, untill the evening late, that there was a great change, as in part ſhall be ſhewed; for leaſt ſhee ſhould bee lifted up through her former revelation, joyes and rapture, ſo ſhort which endured

<pb n="169" facs="tcp:55234:89"/>written, and for ought wee know, all her ſufferings were: O no, courage then, hold out a little, and I will now diſpatch briefly, endeavouring in the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtrophe</hi> of this our <hi>Tragi-Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,</hi> to recompence thy pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, with the fragrance of ſome ſweet ſmelling cloſe of ſome Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine rarities.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe.</hi> Firſt, Then here wee may learne, <hi>That not the great things of this world makes one happy, but the favour of the great God:</hi> Nothing being able to content the ſoule, but that which is able to fill it, which all this world cannot doe: Shewing that there is nothing ſuch in theſe earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things (as wee imagine) in the evill day or times of tryall.

<pb n="172" facs="tcp:55234:91"/>to bee afraid to ſinne, and to ſtand in awe of the anger of the great God; for though hee may forgive, yet if hee open Hell unto us, keep us in perpetuall fear as upon the rack, as he did this good Hentlewoman, letting Satan looſe to buffet her, oh what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort can we have in ſuch a tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting dying life? having our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe hid form our eyes?</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Hence alſo we may learn, <hi>That the more beloved, uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the ſoundlier beaten, ſifted and tried,</hi> Amos 3. You only have I known, of all the Nations of the Earth, therefore you ſhall not goe unpuniſhed for all your iniquities; wherefore corrections being a ſign of love, not of reprobation (as the Devill perſwades) that the Saints ſhould not be diſcouraged though ſtorme-beaten in their journey
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:55234:91"/>homewards; they may goe to Heaven for all this, as this good Gentlewoman did.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, And ſo here alſo we may gather <hi>what need we have of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to have its perfect work in us, to fit us for the greateſt and moſt ſmarting afflictions:</hi> there being yet ſome light in this darke cloud; <hi>the ſoreſt and moſt ſmarting croſſes, ending uſually in the greateſt and moſt glorious deliverances:</hi> Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe the none-ſuch troubles of <hi>Iacob, Ioſeph, Iob, David,</hi> the Churches forty years Pilgrimage in the Wilderneſſe, &amp; of this good Gentlewoman, all ending in peace and joy; becauſe the promiſe is, <hi>that of neceſsity, the patient abiding of the righteous muſt needs end in joy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixthly, Then alſo we ſee here, that <hi>croſſes and afflictions are only leſſer and greater, as it pleaſes the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:55234:92"/>great God to ſet them on leſſe or more:</hi> as it pleaſes him to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract the light of hs countenance from us, turn looſe Satan upon us, enfatuate our judgements, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving us ſome taſte and ſenſe of his encenſed wrath: Oh! who then can dwell with ſuch everlaſting burnings? and if ſmaler ſins diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered thus ſet on and torment, yea, ſome thoughts only, as in this good Gentlewoman; Oh! what may the greater doe, if he ſhould aggravate them, diſcovering the wrath due unto them, without a ſuitable ſight of mercy? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to break off our ſins betimes, repent of them, and to ſow for our ſelves in righteouſneſſe, that wee may have a ſure reward, and bee able at laſt to ſtand with boldneſſe before the Son of Man.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, So <hi>ſeeing too eager de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:55234:92"/>of feeling coſt this Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſo deare though ſhee had her deſire, therefore not to dote too much upon it;</hi> being reſtleſſe untill they have it, as many good ſoules doe, who like <hi>Rachel</hi> reſtleſſe for children, cryd out ſtill, <hi>comfort, comfort, feeling feeling,</hi> or elſe wee die: But let them be contented of what meaſure thereof God of his infinite wiſedome thinks beſt for them: For, <hi>He who hath created them for eternity of glory, ſurely knowes the beſt meanes and way to bring them thither:</hi> Seeing, feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the beſt is uncertaine, ſhort and quickly vaniſhing; <hi>and too much doted upon and eagerly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, brings us onely to a habit of diſcontentment without it:</hi> whilſt wee cannot bee contented unleſſe every day the Almighty feaſt us, forgetting that wee walk, by faith,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:55234:93"/>and not by ſight; and that the life we now live in the fleſh is by the Faith of the Son of God; viſion and ſenſe, for to come.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, Then behold from this rare experience here this leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>Not to preſcribe or appoint God a way which way to bring us unto glory;</hi> Hee knew the fitteſt and ſhorteſt way to have brought the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> unto the Land to <hi>Canaan,</hi> without paſſing through a red ſea; But out of his infinite wiſedome, he made choyce of the wilderneſſe way unto them, That (as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhewes) <hi>hee might prove them, try them and doe them good at their latter end:</hi> And yet how crooked ſoever his wayes ſeem un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our corrupted ſenſes, they bee alwayes ſtraight, how full ſoever of turnings and windings; as the Pſalmiſts, <hi>That hee brought them
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:55234:93"/>out by a right way unto Canaan:</hi> Therefore to reſt confident herein, that this which God appoints is alwayes beſt for us; whether hee lead us in a wilderneſſe, in a a ſtraight, crooked, ſmooth, tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous long afflicted way, by the gates of Hell unto Heaven, or with a more gentle comfortable gale of joy; let us be contented, ſo he bring us thither, as hee did this good woman here; if by any meanes wee attaine unto a joyfull Reſurrection of the Dead, it is a very great purchaſe as <hi>Paul</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, For (which is the next) Sure it is, <hi>Seeing a glance of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, a little taſte of heavenly joy is ſo prevalent to make us to forget all, even an age of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as this good Gentlewoman found, who thereupon forgot all her
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:55234:94"/>by-paſt troubles ſwallowed up in ſurmounting joyes;</hi> I ſay, if a touch, a taſte, a ſhort glance onely bee ſo forcible and raviſhing. <hi>How ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mountingly excellent glorious and raviſhing ſhall that eſtate bee to drink at the fountaine head of the beatificall viſion, out of the rivers of his pleaſures of ever?</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to reſt confident and patient in all afflictions, ſeeing our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts are at length beyond all our croſſes; ſeeing <hi>God ruines none by afflictions,</hi> but purged, puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, cleanſes, whitens, enlightens and fits us thereby to bee veſſels capacious of ſo much the more glory; out of the ruines of the fleſh, erecting, framing and build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up that glorious ſtruckture of the new creature, to mount up at length out of the wilderneſſe of this world, fraught with Myrthe
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:55234:94"/>and Frankincenſe, and all the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Merchant, unto eternity of glory for ever.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, Next hence obſerve, <hi>That God never comes too late unto his ſervants, but will alwayes bee ſeene in the Mount, making our extremities his opportunities:</hi> as he did unto <hi>Abraham</hi> in <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s caſe, and as this good Gentlewoman found, who being much afflicted, comfortleſſe for many yeares to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, even at the point of death: yet at length hee was entreated, came and revived her, in a ſwifter courſe then the running ſwift Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rets of <hi>Aminadah:</hi> nay, came flying as it were upon the wings of the winde, paſſing and skipping by all the hills of ſinnes and mountaines of her corruptions; when (in her appearing laſt ſuit unto him, and extreame weakneſſe) ſhe had beg'd
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:55234:95"/>now at length once before her death <hi>to open the brazen gates of her hard heart, that the King of glory might enter in;</hi> which was abundantly done. Therefore, though he ſtay never ſo long, let all the hard-hearted gaine by this experience of hers; with the Churches reſolution in <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> I will wait upon him who hides his face from the houſe of <hi>Iacob;</hi> and I will look for him; and reaſon good, For <hi>he never failes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, being waited for, and engaged by ſo many promiſes; wherein it is impoſsible for him to deny himſelfe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Eleventhly, Further alſo hence wee may learn <hi>how to deale with thoſe in affliction in whatſoever Caſe:</hi> View them well firſt, be not too brief with them; Heare them vent themſelves, Try the ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes and palſes of their diſeaſe,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:55234:95"/>
               <hi>as Iobs</hi> three friends who ſate (it is written) ſeven dayes and nights ſilent, becauſe they ſaw his griefe was great; for <hi>unſeaſonable comforts are and prove but like <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aine falling upon hard ſtones, which runs off as faſt as it comes, making no impreſsions:</hi> whilſt their buz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing heads and tranſported ſpirits are gadding, plodding elſewhere with ſtrong diverſions; as it fell out with this good Gentlewoman; who paſſed not for all was ſaid unto her for a long time, neither was hope of cure, untill the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils counſell was bewrayed.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Therefore, it behoves to be circumſpect and patient awhile to finde out the cauſe and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of diſtempers, or elſe no good can bee done; for though <hi>counſell in the heart of a man be like deep waters, yet Salomon</hi>
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:55234:96"/>ſhewes, that a man of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will fetch it out.</p>
            <p n="3">2. And then his counſell being bewrayed, the Patient muſt be mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, meekly and gently uſed, not hald and puld, hurried and chid; O no, this is a wrong courſe; but uſed with abundant patience and love, waited upon, with many good words, and ſuffered to bemoane themſelves as much as they liſt, repeating one thing ſtill over and over againe, as often as they pleaſe; Many good things fit for them muſt be uttered in their hearing not too ſoone preſſd upon them, as ſpoken unto others; they muſt have here a little and there a little, not preſſd beyond their ſtrength; wonne by degrees with a loving ſweet affable car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; as all theſe yeares of this good womans trouble ſhee was
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:55234:96"/>ſerved by all her friends which wonne much, and wrung many things from her in love which could not otherwiſe poſſibly have been attained: For alas, <hi>All that while they are in a ſpirituall fever; and what mad Phyſitian will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture to give phyſick in a burning fever?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. When they begin to mend and become more docible, wee muſt not then bring like <hi>Iobs</hi> friends (who miſtook his caſe) the Law for the Goſpel. This is Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans work uſually, moſt of them are to apt to lay too much load upon themſelves; It is an eaſie matter to throw down, when one is a going <hi>(facilis diſcenſus Averni)</hi> then it is Satans work, down with it, down with it, down with it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the ground: <hi>O, but it is the work of the great God to raiſe
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:55234:97"/>one up who is dejected:</hi> It is the work of the Holy Ghoſt in that caſe to raiſe up, encourage, and convince us in a deſpairing eſtate: Wherefore ſpirituall Phyſitians muſt be like Chriſt the great Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian, of whom it is ſaid, <hi>A bruiſed reed ſhall hee not break, and ſmoaking flax ſhall he not quench, untill hee bring forth judgement unto victory,</hi> or a victorious ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification in us: as wee were glad to doe by this good creature, by all gentle meanes to toll on, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold and cheriſh her ſpirit, untill God at length came in, and did all.</p>
            <p>Twelfly, But lo, lo, whilſt we are now towards a concluſion, where <hi>Thanksgiving</hi> alſo appeareth, in treating on the paſſages of this <hi>Rare Caſe</hi> not to be forgotten, ſo as the ſtupidity, dulneſſe, dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:55234:97"/>and ſluggiſhneſſe of our ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full diſpoſitions might be whetted and ſet on edge more then ever thereby unto more exact and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous frequent actings thereof; <hi>for our freedome from thoſe innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble troubles, ſorrowes, ſickneſſes and diſeaſes, both inward and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, of all ſorts, which tormenteth many others better then we; who enjoying abundance of unpercei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, ordinary mercies, doe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſlight and neglect the ſame:</hi> For, when vexations of tooth-ach, ſtone, ſtrangury, convulſions, gout, palſies, burning, fevers, agues, ulcers, ſwellings, broken and diſ-joynted bones, ſtreined ſinews, diſplaced arteries, inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations and the like annoy us; terrors of conſcience, with a wounded ſpirit; Satans inceſſant buffettings, apprehenſions of Hell,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:55234:98"/>and the wrath of God affright us: O what torments, dolefull dayes and miſeries doe we endure, to bee as it is, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. <hi>In per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall feares, having no aſſurance of our lives?</hi> And yet O how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull are wee and ſenſleſſe of ſo great and wonderfull mercies, as daily and nightly we are freed from, the leaſt whereof (when their contraries ſuprize us) makes us cry out as moſt miſerable: witneſſe this good Gentlewoman fore-mentioned, <hi>Who being and living in continuall fears, valued nothing at all this world, took no comfort in any thing here below:</hi> And yet it is ſtrange how daily we ſlubber over our <hi>Thanks givings</hi> and freedom from miſeries we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, as though they were not moſt great and wonderfull, every mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning renewed mercies; or elſe we

            <pb n="188" facs="tcp:55234:99"/>
            <p>Thirteenthly, As we began with this good Creature, who led forth the <hi>Van</hi> in a <hi>Tempeſt;</hi> ſo now ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been victorious, let us ſo far honour her as to <hi>bring up the Reere,</hi> and make the <hi>laſt Uſe,</hi> which ſhe her ſelfe made unto all ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Survivers howſoever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, eſpecially, by <hi>diſſertion or hardneſſe</hi> of <hi>Heart: That they ſhould upon experience of her</hi> CASE, <hi>and Gods goodneſſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her, not be ſo diſcouraged in any eſtate whatſoever, as to give over the uſe of meanes, but to ply them ſtill; truſt and wait, and they would prevaile at length.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore then from hence, let all ſuch learn to wait and depend upon God: <hi>And ſince</hi> (as it is <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.) <hi>hee waits in all their troubles for an opportunity to ſhew mercy unto them; therefore to wait and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:55234:99"/>upon him untill hee come:</hi> For though they may wait long, yet herein they may abundantly comfort themſelves, That God will comfort them according to all the dayes they have beene af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, and the years wherein they have ſeene evill; That hee who hath ſhewed us ſore and great troubles, will yet quicken us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and bring us up from the depth of the earth; encreaſe our greatneſſes and comfort us on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſide, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 71.20.21.
